 I use these dotfiles to set up my environment on my Linux and macOS machines by providing custom configurations for various software applications. The directory structure is messy and in need of cleaning, which I will do at some point. Sorry about that. 

## Features

- Customized configurations for various software applications, including:
  - Vim
  - NeoVim (NVChad and OVIWrite)
  - Yabai (MacOS only)
  - skhd (MacOS only)
  - Sketchybar (MacOS only)
- Easy-to-understand organization and setup instructions
- Compatibility with both Linux and macOS environments

## Vim, NeoVim and OVIWrite

- I use Vim, NeoVim and OVIWrite
- My vimrc is mostly legacy - I keep it here for old time's sake. Most of my writing is done on [OVIWrite](https://github.com/MiragianCycle/OVIWrite), a personalized Integrated Writing Environment built using LazyVim
- I code using the base config found on NVChad
- I have both OVIWrite and NVChad running on my systems, using aliases to switch between the two depending on if I am writing or coding 

## Emacs 

- Try as I might, I can't stop myself from using Emacs. Org-mode, particularly, is a huge draw. This is my first emacs config and really not something you should use.
